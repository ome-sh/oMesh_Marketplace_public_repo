🛍️ About oMesh
oMesh is a scalable, AI-powered e-commerce marketplace designed for ultra-fast delivery and frictionless seller onboarding. Initially launched in Panama, the platform combines intelligent logistics and in-house AI infrastructure to offer a seamless and localized experience for buyers and sellers.

🧠 AI Infrastructure
All AI models are self-hosted on custom GPU servers, with the ability to scale elastically via cloud GPU rental. Our AI tools include:

Semantic Search Engine (multilingual, vector-based)

LLM-Powered Listing Generator (automated product descriptions)

AI Agent for customer service and product guidance

Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech Bots for WhatsApp, Telegram, web, and mobile

Translation Engine to localize listings in English, Spanish, and Chinese

We primarily use open-source models under MIT or Apache-2.0 licenses.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)

Backend: Node.js (REST APIs, OAuth, Webhooks)

AI & Tooling: Python (FastAPI, LLM integrations, STT/TTS, scheduling)

Databases: MariaDB, MongoDB, Weaviate (vector DB)

Orchestration: Kubernetes (soon in production)

CI/CD: Docker, GitHub Actions, internal DevOps tools

🚚 Flash Fulfillment Strategy
oMesh operates a Flash Fulfillment Center network — small, strategically placed warehouses in dense urban areas. This enables:

Same-day or even minute-level delivery in city zones

Cash or Card on Delivery (zero risk for buyers)

Smart route planning and order grouping

💸 Business Model (for Sellers)
Zero subscription cost

Flat 10% commission per sale

$2 flat shipping fee per product (includes fulfillment)

Free shipping to most Panama addresses when customers buy ~3–4 items

🌍 Global Vision
oMesh is designed to scale in 3 phases:

Panama (active) – full logistics & marketplace integration

Emerging countries without fulfillment-enabled marketplaces

Global – oMesh as an open, AI-first commerce infrastructure
